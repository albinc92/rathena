//        ranged attackers. This flag also overrides the 'provoke' target.
// 0x008: When set, mobs scatter as soon as they lose their target. Use this mode
//        to make it much harder to mob-train by hiding and collecting them on a
//        single spot (ie: GrimTooth training)
// 0x010: If set, mob skills defined for friends will also trigger on themselves.

//        hit by skills.
// 0x100: When set, a mob will pick a random skill from it's list and start from

//        on six lines in the mob_skill_db, only the entry that is actually used

// On official servers, Storm Gust consists of 81 units that all deal 3x3 splash damage "away from center". Due to

// The 3rd job skills Flame Launcher and Cannon Spear can completely miss.
// Set this to "no" to calculate a path from the caster to the target instead and hit everything near that path.
